                PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his
                start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a

                in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as
                the wealthiest man in the world.
